        Taejongdae was named after the 29th king of Silla Dynasty King Taejong Muyeol (Kim Chun-chu).

        cliffs surrounded by dense pine forests and the sea and he enjoyed shooting arrows here. 
        Taejongdae is abundant in its cliffs, which seem as if they have been trimmed by the sea, 
        and uniquely-formed rocks, believed to have been formed during the 4th interglacial period 120,000 years ago.
        The breathtaking views here enable visitors to appreciate Busan's natural history.
